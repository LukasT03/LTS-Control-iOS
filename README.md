# ⚙️📱 LTS Control for iOS

LTS Control for iOS is the companion app for the [LTS Respooler](https://github.com/LukasT03/LTS-Respooler). The app allows you to connect via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), monitor spool progress, and adjust key settings such as speed, transfer amount, and motor strength.

It’s primarily built with SwiftUI to be as platform-native as possible and supports Live Activities. It's my first iOS app so the code might be a bit messy!
